# LearningC
This is a repo for code written during my studies. I want to learn C and C++ as a part of my studies in embedded systems and control.

Throughout the folders here, comments will be added as notes for myself, explaining why, or in some cases, what, I am doing.

This is a quick change to see if I can get pull to work.
