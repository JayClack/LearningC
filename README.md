# LearningC
This is a repo for code written during my studies. I want to learn C and C++ as a part of my studies in embedded systems and control.

Throughout the folders here, comments will be added as notes for myself, explaining why, or in some cases, what, I am doing.

I am aware of the possibility that I am making more commits, pushes, and branches than would be considered best practice elsewhere. This is purposeful, as I am learning how to use git, become familiar with the console, and just improve in general.
